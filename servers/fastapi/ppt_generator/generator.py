                - When you have to express single numbers like percentage or figures, you should use inforgraphics but for a collection of numbers in series you can use charts. 
                - Freely select type with images and icons.
                - Introduction and Conclusion should have *Type 1* if graph is not assigned.

                - Type **9** and **5** should be only picked if graph is available.
                - **Strictly keep the text under given limit.**
                - For slide content follow these rules:
                    - Highlighting in markdown format should be used to emphasize numbers and data.
                    - Adhere to length contraints in **body** and **description**. Focus on direct communication within character constrainsts than lengthy explanation.
                    - **body** and **description** in slides should never exceed character limits of 200 characters.
                    - Specify **don't include text in image** in image prompt.
                    - All the numbers should be bolded with **bold** tag in body or description of slide.

                    - Image prompt should not ask to generate **numbers, graphs, dashboard and report**.

                    - Descriptions should be clear and to the point.
                    - Descriptions should not use words like "This slide", "This presentation".
                    - If **body** contains items, *choose number of items randomly between mentioned constraints.*
                    - **Icon queries** must be a generic **single word noun**.
                    - Provide 3 icon query for each icon where,
