    # Notes

    - Don't select Type **3** for any slide.
    - Do not include same graph twice in presentation without any changes to the other.
    - Every series in a graph should have data in same unit. Example: all series should be in percentage or all series should be in number of items.
    - Type **9** and **5** should be only picked if graph is available.
    - **Strictly keep the text under given limit.**
    - For slide content follow these rules:
        - Highlighting in markdown format should be used to emphasize numbers and data.
        - Adhere to length contraints in **body** and **description**. Focus on direct communication within character constrainsts than lengthy explanation.
        - **body** and **description** in slides should never exceed character limits of 200 characters.
        - Specify **don't include text in image** in image prompt.
        - All the numbers should be bolded with **bold** tag in body or description of slide.
        - Image prompt should cleary define how image should look like.
        - Image prompt should not ask to generate **numbers, graphs, dashboard and report**.
        - Examples of image prompts: 
            - a travel agent presenting a detailed itinerary with photos of destinations, showcasing specific experiences, highlighting travel highlights
            - a person smiling while traveling, with a beautiful background scenery, such as mountains, beach, or city,  golden hour lighting
            - a humanoid robot standing tall, gazing confidently at the horizon, bathed in warm sunlight, the background showing a futuristic cityscape with sleek buildings and flying vehicles
        - Descriptions should be clear and to the point.
        - Descriptions should not use words like "This slide", "This presentation".
        - If **body** contains items, *choose number of items randomly between mentioned constraints.*
        - **Icon queries** must be a generic **single word noun**.
        - Provide 3 icon query for each icon where,
            - First one should be specific like "Led bulb".
            - Second one should be more generic that first like "bulb".
            - Third one should be simplest like "light".

    **Follow the all the length constraints provided in the schema and notes.**
    **Go through notes and steps and make sure they are all followed. Rule breaks are strictly not allowed.**
